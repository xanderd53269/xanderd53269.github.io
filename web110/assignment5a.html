    <p>For the one and only activity in communication, I chose #1, which was to complete a tutorial on internet services. It starts with a diagram showing all 4 different internet services, such as: communication, information retrieval, web, and the world wide web. For communication, it includes mail and telnet, as well as IRC and VoIP, multiple of these terms I am already familiar with, such as VoIP, as it is what Skype uses as well as chats in video games. For information retrieval, I already know FTP, but Archie, Gopher, and VERONICA are completely new. Those 3 are used in public FTP, to search for, retrieve, and display content. I could apply all of this by researching FTP more, and maybe using it to distribute content if I ever need to, as well as knowing what protocols use what, to maybe teach someone how it works or help with fixing something. </p>
