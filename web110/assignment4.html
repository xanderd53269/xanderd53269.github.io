    <p> The first activity (both are for networking, Thursday I’ll do the 2 for security) I chose was #2, which was to review my IP address settings, which since I’m on windows, I am following that guide. There was somewhat a difference though, as my desktop PC isn’t connected through Wi-Fi, but I do have a wireless antenna plugged in to help with Bluetooth and in case I need to tether my phone to my pc, since I have unlimited mobile data and have had to do that before. I also already know that lower end/older devices operate on 2.4ghz and not 5ghz, and 5ghz tends to be faster. I have also had to restart my modem, and that process is almost exactly like resetting a pc, turning it off and then removing the power plug, waiting, and then plugging it back in and turning it on. And for DHCP, I have everything set to auto, but if I had issues, I might manually change the DNS to Cloudflare’s or Google’s, as it’s likely that would help, but for now its all set to auto. Also, for my ethernet connection, I still have ipv4 and ipv6 on, as on rare occasions, applications might refuse to work if ipv6 is on as well, so if the need arises, I can always disable it and leave only ipv4 on. Also, through Ipconfig, I see VirtualBox has a lot of adapters, so that’s interesting. In addition, I have tried in the past t renewing ipconfig, so this is not the first time doing this. I could apply this as I may need to use it all again in case my network fails, or maybe helping someone else with their network not working.</p>
    
    <p> For the second activity, I chose #3, which was verifying connectivity, in my case through wired ethernet. I know that on both a router and a modem they have a LED indicator, which is a representation of the actual signal bouncing back and forth between whatever is connected, when it is on then it means the signal is being received, when off it means nothing is coming through, with traffic it should be flashing inconsistently. Mine is flashing orange, so therefore it’s receiving something and working correctly. I can apply this to teach someone else how a network works, and again more troubleshooting. Also, to note, when I pinged my local address vs my DNS, my local address was instant, but my DNS took about 15 milliseconds, and this is likely because of proximity, as I have no idea how far away the DNS server is, but I do know how far away my local network is. Also, I can login to my router by putting my IP address into my browser, but most people already know that. </p>
