    <p> The first activity (both are for networking) I chose was #2, which was to review my IP address settings, which since I’m on windows, I am following that guide. There was somewhat a difference though, as my desktop PC isn’t connected through Wi-Fi, but I do have a wireless antenna plugged in to help with Bluetooth and in case I need to tether my phone to my pc, since I have unlimited mobile data and have had to do that before. I also already know that lower end/older devices operate on 2.4ghz and not 5ghz, and 5ghz tends to be faster. I have also had to restart my modem, and that process is almost exactly like resetting a pc, turning it off and then removing the power plug, waiting, and then plugging it back in and turning it on. And for DHCP, I have everything set to auto, but if I had issues, I might manually change the DNS to Cloudflare’s or Google’s, as it’s likely that would help, but for now its all set to auto. Also, for my ethernet connection, I still have ipv4 and ipv6 on, as on rare occasions, applications might refuse to work if ipv6 is on as well, so if the need arises, I can always disable it and leave only ipv4 on. Also, through Ipconfig, I see VirtualBox has a lot of adapters, so that’s interesting. In addition, I have tried in the past t renewing ipconfig, so this is not the first time doing this. I could apply this as I may need to use it all again in case my network fails, or maybe helping someone else with their network not working.</p>
    
    <p> For the second activity, I chose #3, which was verifying connectivity, in my case through wired ethernet. I know that on both a router and a modem they have a LED indicator, which is a representation of the actual signal bouncing back and forth between whatever is connected, when it is on then it means the signal is being received, when off it means nothing is coming through, with traffic it should be flashing inconsistently. Mine is flashing orange, so therefore it’s receiving something and working correctly. I can apply this to teach someone else how a network works, and again more troubleshooting. Also, to note, when I pinged my local address vs my DNS, my local address was instant, but my DNS took about 15 milliseconds, and this is likely because of proximity, as I have no idea how far away the DNS server is, but I do know how far away my local network is. Also, I can login to my router by putting my IP address into my browser, but most people already know that. </p>

    <p> For the first and only activity for security, I chose #1, which was to complete 2 tutorials, the first about internet safety, the other about internet security. For internet security, I already know about SSL, as I have used it to move files securely to my Steam Deck from my pc, and for email phishing, most of the time it is obvious when it’s a scam, as it will contain inconsistent grammar, bad spelling, and since I mostly use Gmail, it tries to warn me of possible spam, even branching off to text messages, which interestingly enough most of the phishing I get is from text, not so much email. For passwords in internet safety, I still personally do not trust password managers, as they can always be broken into, and if I put something important into it, like a bank account password, then the results could be catastrophic. So, I would rather save myself the possible headache, and keep a password book, or keep them in a document that’s locked locally by a pin, 4 numbers I know very well, that aren’t my DOB. Also, most of the browsers I use, when it comes to security will tell me if it’s secure or not, normally with a “before you proceed” screen. I could apply this all to protect myself online and teach others to do the same and prevent the consequences of bad security. </p>

    <p> For the one and only activity in web accessibility, I chose #1, which was to read “What is accessibility?” by Mozilla. It starts with defining accessibility, which is offering access to those who have some kind of disability, and with web sites it focuses on visual impairments. I have a visual impairment, but it’s only my right eye, as I am cross eyed, but not color blind or even blindness of any kind. Also screen readers are relevant, as a couple months ago Reddit decided to make third party apps paid, based on API usage, some of those apps had features the official app did not have, such as screen readers, essentially blocking the visually impaired from being able to use the site. For the deaf, it means simply adding a text alternative, and mobility, might use eye tracking, I’ve even seen someone beat Fallout 3 only using eye tracking, so its definitely feasible to use it for day-to-day use. It also went over cognitive disabilities, which could be aided by keeping any distractions to a minimum and using consistent layouts on webpages. I can apply this by always keeping in mind that not everyone can use the internet the same, and that some people need assistance, most of which is rather simple to account for. </p>
