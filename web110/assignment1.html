    <p>The activity I chose was #3, tracing internet traffic. What it was, was seeing where packets must go until they reach their destination, taking note of other IP addresses. I have not used tracert before at all, but I have used ping before, to check if I could connect to anything, though that was mostly because Windows saying I was connected but had no internet, which was confusing since most sites worked fine. But the main thing I learned here was that when you go to a website, your packets don't just go to 1 place, it has to go through multiple parts, with the first being your ISP. When I ran tracert on Howtogeek, it went to multiple addresses, then started timing out, then another address, and more timing out, so something must've errored out, and the most hops are 30 and the command stopped trying at 30. Wikiversity went a lot better, only needing 12 hops and completing. I believe this will be useful to my environment since if I am building websites, then I need to make sure people can access it fully, and this will help greatly when troubleshooting, even if it isn't my website, but someone else's, like trying to see what part of the connection isn't responding and going from there to fix it. </p>
