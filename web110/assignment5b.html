    <p>HTML summary: Going into HTML, I had almost no experience whatsoever, so almost everything performed here was new to me, as the only relevant experience I have is a small amount of JavaScript from High School. I may or may not have used the unordered list command before, but I don’t remember it being "ul" and "li" so that’s likely entirely new to me. I can apply this by using unordered lists for a table of contents in a webpage, or a table of sources, making it look more presentable and not just multiple links consecutively. I can also use this if I ever decide to become a real developer on GitHub and can use my experience here to look more professional and organized. </p>
