    <h1>SQL Summary</h1>
    <p>Databases and SQL are familiar sounding, but I have no prior experience with either of these concepts, but after completing the assignment and the tutorials, I have a much better understanding of these topics. In the activities, I learned how to filter a database by one of itâ€™s values, which I know will be very useful if I ever need to use a database, I also learned how to update a database, count a specific value, add new information, and specifically for retrieving information, you can use the select command to retrieve all data, as the where command is for specific data. I can use all of this in my future environment if I ever decide to become a research analyst, or maybe more likely if I wanted to focus entirely on SQL, I could become a SQL developer, and be managing databases full time. I could also apply this by making my own database, perhaps if I ever start a business, I could use it to keep track of important data, for easier retrieval. </p>

    
    <ul>
<li>SELECT * FROM Customers;</li>
<p>Finds all customers, since no "FROM" is specified. In general it simply selects data from the database and shows it.</p>      
<li>SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country='USA';</li>
<p> Finds all Customers from the USA, acts like a filter, showing all data within the specified criteria.</p>      
<li>SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Products;</li>
<p>The count shows in numbers how many rows have what has been specified, in this case the Products rows.</p>
<li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
VALUES ('Cardinal','Tom B. Erichsen','Skagen 21','Stavanger','4006','Norway');</li>      
<p>The insert into command creates new records, in this case customer info.</p>
<li>UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName='Alfred Schmidt', City='Frankfurt'
WHERE CustomerID=1;
</li>
<p>Like the command name implies, it updates already existing records, so in this case it updates the first customer's name and city, as the ID is 1.</p>      
    </ul>
