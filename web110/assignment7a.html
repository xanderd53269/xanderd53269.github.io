    <h1>Multimedia summary</h1>
    <p>After completing these activities, I learned how to properly include SVG images, embed YouTube videos, and change both of the elements’ respective width and height, as when it came to adding a YouTube video, I did not realize you needed to replace “v=watch” with “embed/” and now that I know how to resize images, I can make sure they don’t get in the way of the text or other images and videos. I can apply this to my future environment by making my own websites look more interactive and have more features, as its quite difficult to think of any websites that have no images or videos, and those elements combined make it easier to learn something or simply make a website look more interesting.</p>
