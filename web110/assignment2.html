For my first activity, I chose #5, which was installing plugins and reviewing the ones I already have, possibly installing more. I am already familiar with plugins, as one of the first things I did when I got my own pc, was choose a browser and add an adblocker. I learned that plugins used to not be so common and simple to install, and that even doing a simple task, like playing a video on a browser would require a plugin. Even though I have a lot of plugins, I know that I will likely need more as well as getting rid of the ones I no longer use. For instance, I should get rid of AdNauseam, as I already have uBlock Origin, since they do the same task, and on rare occasions conflict with each other.

For my second activity, I chose #6, which was to check my actual browser for HTML5 compatibility and to look and see how many other browsers supported it. I learned that not all browsers support HTML5 fully, and that it has been around for a long time, 15 years ago. I already somewhat knew that second part, since Iâ€™ve seen the logo quite a few times, and I never knew anything other than HTML5 existed. A way I could apply this could be if I am having an issue with a feature, and I try and use another browser, I could check for compatibility for said feature and use whichever browser supports it.
