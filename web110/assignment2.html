For my first activity, I chose #5, which was installing plugins and reviewing the ones I already have, possibly installing more. I am already familiar with plugins, as one of the first things I did when I got my own pc, was choose a browser and add an adblocker. I learned that plugins used to not be so common and simple to install, and that even doing a simple task, like playing a video on a browser would require a plugin. Even though I have a lot of plugins, I know that I will likely need more as well as getting rid of the ones I no longer use. For instance, I should get rid of AdNauseam, as I already have uBlock Origin, since they do the same task, and on rare occasions conflict with each other.

For my second activity, I chose #6, which was to check my actual browser for HTML5 compatibility and to look and see how many other browsers supported it. I learned that not all browsers support HTML5 fully, and that it has been around for a long time, 15 years ago. I already somewhat knew that second part, since I’ve seen the logo quite a few times, and I never knew anything other than HTML5 existed. A way I could apply this could be if I am having an issue with a feature, and I try and use another browser, I could check for compatibility for said feature and use whichever browser supports it.

      For my first project in search engines, I chose #2, which was to compare 4 search engines with their results, and which one has the best UI. Out of the 4, I’ve only ever used Google and Bing, and I got the best results for this with Bing, although Google is still mostly on track, Bing explains exactly what I searched up on the right side of the tab. Ask is a bit all over the place and Yahoo is really like Bing, but Bing has more features. I also like how Bing looks more than Google’s minimalism, and I am more used to using Bing.

For the second project I chose #1, which was to complete 2 tutorials, the first being how to search for things with more accuracy, judging the content itself, and how to read a webpage. The tutorial itself is kind of outdated but very easy to understand, for example I already know you shouldn’t believe everything you see, and to not search for things like you’re asking a actual person, you would search for specific terms. I think the tutorial itself is more for people using a web browser for the first time, rather than someone who has been using it daily for years, though I do tend to forget you can use a hyphen to exclude results, but normally I just put the terms in quotes so I ger exactly what I am looking for. The second being an overview of search engines with multiple terms and definitions. For instance, I learned that search engines don’t just search for a term throughout the entire internet, but instead use a premade database. Then that is where a web crawler comes in, to search in the database for whatever was inputted into the engine. Also, I somewhat realized this when I was doing project #2 but Bing includes Yahoo’s results, so that is why they are so similar when it comes to what they’ve found.
