    <h1>Final Project Scrope and Objectives</h1>
    <p>The objectives and scope of my final project, for the topic, I am thinking of doing web browsers, as I am very familiar with them, and would likely do best at explaining them. For instance, going through what installation looks like, adding and removing extensions, where to get extensions, how to search effectively, etc. I likely won’t be going through every aspect, as that can easily make this into a 10-20+ minute presentation, so I will stick to the basics. </p>
    <h2>Project Management</h2>
    <p>I already know a little bit about project management, for instance there is already software made to assist in completing projects, and that this is not a new concept, as even from the 1700’s with Adam Smith there have been philosophies for how companies should work in producing things. However, Gantt charts are entirely new to me, and I could use them to plan out how I am doing the project, like right now I am brainstorming what I’ll do, and I can add that to the first week. Then the second week, I can advance into planning exactly what I will do, and then the week after I will complete the project and edit it.</p>
