    <h1>What I learned In CSS</h1>
    <p style="color:tomato;">For CSS at least, this does feel familiar, but I think I have only used inline CSS, or something like it, as I don’t remember having to create an external style sheet, although I do see the value now in using that in conjunction with inline CSS. I know that when it comes to webpages, how it looks is very important, as most people expect a modern website to look good, with fancy animations and such, so I can use what I learned here to make my websites look a lot more modern and stylistic, instead of something out of 1996 or something, as even more basic websites for niche purposes look so much better than something from 15+ years ago. I can apply what I learned by trying to learn even more, like as I mentioned, most big name websites have animations, and are made to be really flashy but easy to use, even my android phone has animations in its menus, so learning more CSS would be a very wise choice, and branching off even further I might be able to use what I’ve learned here in user interface design, or become a UX (user experience) developer. ALSO, important thing: In step 5 of this assignment, what I just inputted right before this is the same as step 6 right? It’s somewhat confusing. </p>
