    <p>The activity I chose was #1, which was to complete 2 tutorials, 1 being for email basics, and the other being an overview. My first impressions from the first tutorials were that it is more for older people, as I receive emails every day, from Blackboard, Reddit, and even a newsletter. Most of the information listed I already know, except maybe the online address book, but then again, I don’t use Yahoo Mail, so I didn’t know it existed. Though on my PC and phone for Gmail, the calendar is considered another web page/app as it is not included in Gmail. Also using keyboard shortcuts, I never knew how to do before, so maybe I can apply this by researching what shortcuts there are and what they do to help speed up things. Also, another highlight from both tutorials is spam, in my experience though somehow I’ve gotten more spam texts then emails, so I think I’m doing a good job avoiding them, and email itself is slower then a text or call, so understanding that if a message is important, then it shouldn’t be sent with email, but instead with a call, to have a better chance that the recipient will get the message and possibly even faster, as almost no one checks their email multiple times a day. </p>
